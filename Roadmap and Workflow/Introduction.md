# Objectives:
* Creation of an efficient, flexible and artistic 3D-Graphical Engine with the purpose of creating FP-POV video games (read Game-Engine Capabilities section)
* Writing of a story that fits the artistic beauty and computing capabilities of the engine
* Creation of 3D-Models using blender or any other free/open source software
* Creation of original soundtracks fitting to the themes of the game


# Game-Engine Capabilities:

## First Phase:
* The Game-Engine or short GE should be able to run simple geometrical shapes rendered in real-time using one of the available graphical-api such as OpenGL, Vulkan or DirectX
* GE should be able to have playback capabilities for mouse and keyboard input reading
* GE should be able to have multiple instances of a camera rendering efficiently
* GE projection matrices should be suitable for FP-POV

## Second Phase:
* Understanding indexing in 3D-Model files such as .obj
* Creation of a file reader that would load the information from .obj files to the engine to render

## Third Phase:
* Implementing Shaders
* Implementing Specular and Diffuse lighting with different materials
* Implementing Shadows

## Fourth Phase:
* Reflection and Water Tesselation (if needed)

## Fifth Phase:
* Collision Control
* Hit-Boxes
* Mechanics bucket
* Interaction with in-game models

## nth Phase:
* ~add here more~
* Realism (if the java compiler allows the heavy load)
